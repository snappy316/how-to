# How-To

This is a simple app that stores how-to lists, and the steps associated with each list.

## Approach

This app uses nested resources within Rails to associate steps with their individual list. Each step has a `list_id` that associates it with the list.

## Collaborators

I got lots of help for this one. Tim and Mike helped clarify some routing and controller issues, while Brook refreshed my memory of the lecture exercise, and got steps to link correctly with their lists. Rails API Docs and Rails Guides also proved helpful.
